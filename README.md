# Cookbook

## Objective
Create an application which serves purpose of a cookbook.

## Criteria
- Ease of use
- Scalability
- Code efficiency
  
## Summary
This application is being build in order to enchance my personal coding skills and an ability to keep my repository clean and well-organised. The language of choice is Python due to general ease of use and already aquired knowledge in this topic. In long-term view I plan recreating this project in Java in order to optimise performance. Also, I'd like to experiment with creating an app for mobile devices in sometime.

## Functionality
This application is supposed to allow adding a cooking recipe and filling it with satisfying amount of details. Such details may be vary - from a simple list of ingredients to a subjective difficulty or personal notes. To meet the user's needs options of editing and removing recipes from the cookbook should also be provided. Storing recipes in a seperate file or files is necessary for the whole project to work properly. Option of filtering known recipes is supposed to be added in order to provide some scalability to the aplication. As filter we can consider: combinations of required ingredients, elapsed time to prepare the meal, etc. Firstly, whole project is planed to be operable through VS Code terminal, but later a GUI will be added.
  
## Resources
- VS Code with the Python extension
- Python 3.12
